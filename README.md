You can download any file from Google Drive in 3 simple steps, I created this bash script because sometimes I needed to download WordPress backups from Google Drive on a server.
# Step 1 
Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/YasirRWebDesigner/googleDriveDownloader`
# Step 2
Goto the googleDriveDownloader dir and run the script `sh ./transfer.sh`
# Step 3
Write the file name i.e `backup.zip`
# Step 4
Write the file ID from Google Drive, and make sure the file is set to public.
